	 * This method is used to write a devLog entry to some support (database, file, etc.) or output
	 * It receives an array with the following information:
	 *
	 * pid =>		page where the call happened (if relevant, may be empty)
	 * severity =>	severity of the log entry
	 * message =>	main message of the log entry
	 * key =>		some key to identify the origin of the log entry (e.g. an extension's key)
	 * microtime =>	the microtime at which the entry happened (microtime is used to make sure we have different times for near-concurrent entries)
	 * location =>	the file where the call was triggered
	 * line =>		the line at which the call was triggered
	 * user =>		the BE user who was logged in at the time where the entry was written (may be empty)
	 * date =>		the timestamp at which the entry happened (less precise, but more usable than the microtime)
	 * ip =>		the IP address of the client machine which was making the request that triggered the entry
	 * data =>		additional information related to the entry, as a PHP array
	 *
	 * @abstract
	 * @param	array	$logEntry: addition information related to the log entry
	 * @return void
